Projects for the Pioneer Museum

There are currently (Feb 5, 2018) two installed devices: the entryway motion sensor
that triggers WWI sounds, and the periscope touch sensor that triggers the machine
gun sounds and lights.  There is a third device that simulates the light from a 
smoldering cigarette and plays someone humming "Over There", but this device has
not yet been installed.

The sound assets are stored in the assets file. The are either public domain or
were purchased.
